<!--<h4 name="net1">A Linear Response Model for Systemic Risk in Shared Portfolio Networks</h4>-->
<p>We modeled the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone_crisis">Eurozone crisis</a> as systemic risk propagation in the network financial institutions who lent money to the GIPSI (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland) governments.</p>
<p>We developed a phenomenological model for the response dynamics of the bipartite market of investors in the GIPSI sovereign debt, with investors on one side and GIPSI sovereing bonds on the other side. The results from our model seem to be inline with the real world events of Eurocrisis.</p>
<p>In our model the behavior of the banks and the market are each determined through differential equations related to the their decision-making and psychology. The risk propagation is through investors being susceptible to movements in the GIPSI bond prices and the price itself being susceptible to the trading behavior of the investors. Each of these two sides has their response time and this results in interesting non-trivial dynamics.</p>
