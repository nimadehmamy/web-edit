<p>It is well known that the near horizon geometry of  Extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes ($M=Q$)  in $D>3$ Einstein General Relativity is an $AdS$ space. This suggested that in the region where $l_P\ll r-r_h\ll M$ an observer would be far enough to be approximately near the boundary of the near-horizon $AdS$, but also close enough not to see the global structure of the space. In this region AdS/CFT should provide a good description of the behavior of quantum fields living in the near-horizon space-time.</p>
<p>The question some researchers were interested in was to what extent this relation with AdS/CFT is universal. For this relation to hold, using the Cardy formula, one can show that on the CFT side the product of the entropies of different sectors is only a function of the number of degrees of freedom, and therefore discrete. The entropy of the black hole horizons in this near horizon analogy becomes the AdS entropy and is directly related to the boundary CFT entropy via AdS/CFT. Thus, if such a relation with AdS/CFT would exist for more exotic black holes, a preliminary check for that would be the product of the entropies of all black hole horizons.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as Castro et al., among others, showed, for all the known cases of non-extremal charged and spinning regular and supersymmetric black holes in $D\leq 6$ Einstein GR the product of the entropies is only a function of global charges such as $Q, J$ and non-abelian and higher dimensional analogues. These charges are all quantized in a quantum theory and hence discrete. In particular, the fact that the product of the entropies is independent of the mass, which is not quantized as far as we know, means that there is a chance that a version of AdS/CFT might holds away from extremality.</p>
<p>I examined the same rule in the case of charged Lovelock Black holes. The Lovelock Theory is an extension of Einstein gravity which includes higher powers of the Riemann tensor (see our <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.1696.pdf">paper</a> for details). We found that in these higher order theories the rule breaks down and that the product becomes mass-dependent. I also derived the analytical formula for arbitrary dimensions, which is mass-dependent in general.</p>
