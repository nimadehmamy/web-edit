<p> Finding layouts that optimize the amount of space occupied by the network allows us to address questions regarding wiring efficiency of brains.</p>

<p>We have developed a physical model for efficiently laying out networks &nbsp; in 3D space by modeling them as cross-linked elastic polymers. &nbsp;The phsyical exclusion forces between the polymer strands then determines the layout.</p>
<p>The global ground state of such complex polymer systems is nearly impossible to find. However, heuristical techniques such as simulated annealing can be used to find acceptable low-lying local minima of the Gibbs free energy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The enrgy landscape of similar systems has been studied in polymer physics. Nevertheless, the structure of the underlying network introduces an extra layer of information which leads to interesting new interpretation of the local energy minima and is closely related to topological states in infinite glassy systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
