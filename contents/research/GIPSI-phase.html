            The response of price and holdings to positive and negative shocks in the red and blue phases. In the red phase (left two plots) neither negative (first plot from left) nor positive (second plot)  shocks result in much change in the system. In the blue, unstable phase, however (right two plots) a negative shock (third plot) results in a crash and a positive shock (fourth plot) results in exponential growth (bubble).

            Left: The phase diagram of the GIPSI model. The two behavioral parameters "inverse proce elasticity," $\alpha$, and the "income elasticity of demand," $\beta$ are the phase variables. The red phase is the stable phase and the blue phase is unstable.
            Right: The relaxation time explodes near the phase transition, alluding to a second order type phase transition.

            Using a mean-field approach, we show that our systemic risk model used on the Eurozone crisis exhibits a stable and an unstable phase.
            The unstable phase can result in either an exponentially growing bubble (if the system receives any positive shock) or crash exponentially, resulting in a financial crisis (if the shock is negative).</p>

            We derive the phase transition between these two phases analytically.

        <!--<p> In much of network science, the focus is on the links between the nodes. But in many (if not all) the nodes have attributes, related to the resources (energy, capital, etc.) of the node. In this work I explore the set of the simplest, lowest order, Lagrangians that are possible for such networks with node attributes. It turns out that with a classical approach to fluctuations around an initial equilibrium and with reasonings similar Landau-Ginzburg theories a lot can be said a bout the dynamics of such systems. I also explore the possibility of adding dissipation to the Euler-Lagrange equations of such models. I applied this approach to the problem described <a href="#net1">above</a> and showed that the model presented there is closely related to the most general lowest order generalized Langevin model (Lagrangian plus dissipation) that can be constructed for such a system, thus claiming that the results found there are very general, and that the model is in fact quite general.</p>-->
